# OCR 

For this quick mvp, we combine tesseract with streamlit. Tesseract is an opensource OCR that can be used to extract text from images. 
To start this on your own
1. clone the repo
2. `cd streamlit_ocr`
3. run `make install-deps`
4. run `make start`

This will open up a streamlit app on your local! Note, that once `make install-deps` is ran, we can run this *fully offline*. Furthermore, all uploaded files are saved on the local computer so once the initial dependcies are ran, this can be repeadtly used offline! 

See below for a quick demo!
